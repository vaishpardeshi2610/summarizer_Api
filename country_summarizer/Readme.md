please create an account on this link or any other platform to access data:

https://api-ninjas.com/api/country


The above web page contains an api whose reponse is country data,
try to analyse what params it requires and do an api hit to receive the response

PART-1:
Make an request object with python , and print the response on the console

PART-2:
store some of the key values(any 5 keys and respective values) in some table(Database Table)

PART-3:
make an API to receive data when you send country name as param,
(data you have stored already in the DB this api should retrieve that data)

PART-4:
an API which will make an LLM call along with an prompt to generate an meaningfull summary,
based on the data which you pass, which will be fetched from db before making an LLM call.

if you guys have some questions/doubts we will take it in tomorrow's lecture,
PART-4 will be done in tomorrow's lecture post we understand how to access groq.

You guys may have 10 questions to understand for today, point is not like: all of them should be solved,
but what ever number of questions you actually solve, they should be well understood, and should have thought something about
them.
